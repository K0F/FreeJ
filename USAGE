FreeJ version 0.7 USAGE NOTES
===============================

FreeJ offers you various interfaces to interact with.
in fact, it's a completely asynchronous rendering engine which can even
process javascripts.

to have a tour of the capabilities, you can use the gtk-2 interface
which is the user friendly clicky thing.

FreeJ as a performance instrument can be lively used with the keyboard:
in the web documentation there is a map of the hotkeys.
Good manuality is fundamental. Manu Virtus.

the console controller is shaped on hotkeys coming from the Emacs and Vi
approach to a text editor. in fact FreeJ is using S-Lang to control the
console, an excellent library developed as part of the Jed editor.

the paragraph above recalls familiarity among unix hackers, but don't
worry if you don't get it, you can still find FreeJ interesting.

the text console gives you status information, listing all the layers
and the filters under them, scrolling all status messages and of course
letting you interact thru commands.

press ctrl-h to have a list of them.

now, before continuing here, if you are not familiar with terms like
'blit' and the way the FreeJ multilayered engine works by opening
different media files, i suggest you take a tour of the PDF tutorial
available in the web documentation on http://freej.dyne.org
here it will follow a very dense reference table of hotkeys and commands
to interact with the console and with the rendering screen.

in fact you can interact also from the SDL screen, projecting directly
your screen and controlling variables from the On Screen Display, like
it was until the version 0.6 of FreeJ.

now there is also something new:

you can interact with FreeJ thru the text console, which can be also a
shell opened from the net, i mean a remote terminal which is connected
thru the net, over distance.
with FreeJ you can do VJoE: VeeJay over Ethernet,
which means the following control commands can also be sent thru the net:


LIST OF HOTKEYS, remember:
^ means CTRL key pressed
% means SHIFT key pressed

 %BACKSP  = white matte             ^BACKSP  = black matte
 
VIDEO 4 LINUX LAYER COMMANDS:
 k/m      = switch up/down input channel

 u     = set keyframe step back to 1
 p     = pause (still can seek)
 i     = set/clear mark_in
 o     = set/clear mark_out
 with full indexed avi files you can use:
 n/m    = -/+ double frame / slow motion
 v/b    = -/+ play speed
 caveat: without indexed avi it can crash.

 l/r
 arrows   = go to previous/next word in text

VeeJay over Ethernet TIP:

if you connect thru ssh you need to
$ export DISPLAY=localhost:0
and be sure to have the right permission on the X server
$ xhost +localhost
