FreeJ version 0.8 USAGE NOTES
===============================

NOTE: please look also at http://lab.dyne.org/FreejTutorial

FreeJ offers you various interfaces to interact with.
in fact, it's a completely asynchronous rendering engine which can even
process javascripts.

to have a tour of the capabilities, you can use the gtk-2 interface
which is the user friendly clicky thing.

FreeJ as a performance instrument can be lively used with the keyboard:
in the web documentation there is a map of the hotkeys.
Good manuality is fundamental. Manu Virtus.

the console controller is shaped on hotkeys coming from the Emacs and Vi
approach to a text editor. in fact FreeJ is using S-Lang to control the
console, an excellent library developed as part of the Jed editor.

the paragraph above recalls familiarity among unix hackers, but don't
worry if you don't get it, you can still find FreeJ interesting.

the text console gives you status information, listing all the layers
and the filters under them, scrolling all status messages and of course
letting you interact thru commands.

press ctrl-h to have a quick list of them.

here is a longer list:

LIST OF HOTKEYS, remember:
^ means CTRL key pressed
% means SHIFT key pressed
