FreeJ version 0.2 USAGE NOTES
=============================

This release supports both 16bit and 32bit screens, altough runs better in 
16bit mode (even one filter will not work in 32bit depth).

The interface consists in a on screen display (OSD) reporting informations 
like FPS, the filters that are created, which active and which not, in the 
order they are applied to the Video4Liunux layer.

the commands are (^ means CTRL key pressed):

1 - 5    = create a filter from the 5 implemented and add it on the layer, at 
           the end of the filter chain.
UP/DOWN  = select filters up and down thru the chain
^UP/DOWN = move filters up and down thru the chain
DELETE   = delete selected filter
^DELETE  = delete ALL filters
INSERT   = activate/deactivate filter (without removing it from the chain)
PRINTSCR = display nice and lovely credits
SPACE    = switch fullscreen mode
ESC      = quits (without confirm)
TAB      = turn on/off OSD
^TAB     = turn on/off calibration guidelines (only 16bpp)

other than this, every filter can listen for keys. right now only Delaygrab 
filter does it so, when selecting it on the filter chain, you can change MODE 
and BLOCKSIZE up and down by pressing o/p and l/; .

commands will eventually change in future.
