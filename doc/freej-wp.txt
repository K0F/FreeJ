{OVERVIEW}

  FreeJ aims to be a digital instrument for video livesets, featuring
realtime rendering of multilayered video and chained effect filtering
directly on the screen. FreeJ threats every video source as a layer, making
then possible to dynamically apply on each a chain of filters, loadable as
effect plugins and easily customizable. Layers are planned for rendering of
analog video input, digital movie files, image bitmaps, sound scopes, texts
and eventually more.

  FreeJ is being developed in the hope to provide the GNU community with a
free, modular and highly customizable application to perform video
livesets, based on a GPL'ed framework that lets anybody implement his own
filters concentrating simply on the dsp algorithm developed and furthermore
to combine them over any supported layer.

  FreeJ is Free Software and his sourcecode is released under the Gnu
Public License.

{BACKGROUND}

  As a precedent to FreeJ some of us surely know the GPL'ed software that
Andreas Schiffler wrote in '99 called
{{{ftp://esc2.zkm.de/pub/libbgrab/README}libbgrab}}, implementing some
effects and following the analog idea of giving an easy to use and
optimized API for programmers willing to use video4linux devices. His code
does'nt go further in implementing a multilayered engine, alltough all his
brilliant effects can be easily integrated into FreeJ (without problems
according to GPL license) and can be even combined multiplying the
achievable results.

  More recently, on the 16 april 2001, another brilliant programmer known
as Fukuchi Kentarou released a GPL'ed free software called
{{{http://freshmeat.net/redir/effectv/12883/url_homepage/}EffecTV}},
implementing many new realtime video effects which showed good performance
and quality over a live video signal captured from video4linux devices.
Even those effects can be easily implemented and combined in FreeJ, making
it possible to apply them on any video layer supported.

  Exactly the same day FreeJ has been employed for the first time in a
theatre piece performed in the Palazzo della Civilta' Italiana (EUR) in
Rome, in collaboration with the company Giardini Pensili and the actress
Anna Bonaiuto: {{http://giardini.sm/projects/metamorfosi}}. In that context
has been used an effect ported from libbgrab plus other effects coded from
scratch live on the set.

  At the time this document is being written FreeJ has been employed in
several events including performances in Bologna during the festival
{{{http://www.d-i-n-a.org}digital_is_not_analog01}}, during the
{{{http://www.hackmeeting.org}hackmeeting[0x7d1]}} in Catania and during
the {{{http://residence.aec.at/liquidmusic}LiquidMusic-Checkpoint}}
festival in Judenburg, while more upcoming performance are being scheduled.

{INTERNALS}

  FreeJ, as a free modularized GNU/Linux based framework, permits unified
quality control over the rendering of digital video processing and makes it
much easier to write effect algorithms keeping them compatible with as much
devices as possible and making them relying on optimized code.

  FreeJ is being developed in c++ respecting POSIX.1b compliance, releases
will be made available in a packaging permitting easy compilation with
standard GNU free development tools. For rendering to screen is being
linked shared the {{{http://www.libsdl.org}Simple Direct Media Layer}}
library, allready employed by {{{http://www.lokigames.com}lokigames.com}}
for his high performance in porting games under GNU/Linux platform. As a
realtime architecture FreeJ aims to make efficient use of multithreading
optimizing the usage of hardware resources. There's only one layer
implemented yet wich makes use of the video4linux abstracted device for
capturing live video input from the many linux supported hardware devices
(which includes bttv, usb cams and more). Alltough possible, is not planned
any porting to platforms other than GNU/Linux at least in the earliest
development phases.

* {REQUIREMENTS}

  * a working GNU/Linux workstation :)

  * {{{http://www.libsdl.org}Simple Directmedia Layer}} library

  * a {{{http://roadrunner.swansea.linux.org.uk/v4l.shtml}video4linux}}
supported capture card

  * {{{ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/nasm}NASM}} netwide 
assembler compiler

  * an x86 CPU supporting MMX instructions, even better SSI (PentiumIII or 
more)

  * {{{http://www.xfree86.org}XFree86}}, possibly 4.1 running on 
a accelerated supported card

{FEATURES}

  * multilayered video engine

  * layer filtering thru chainable dsp algorithms

  * easy customization of filters

  * MMX/SSI accelerated engine lubrification

  * efficient triple-buffered video grabbing layer

  * modular c++ code structure

  * multithreaded architecture (POSIX.1b compliant)

  * (ab)user friendly OnScreenDisplay interface

  * 100% GNU public licensed Free Software

* {ROADMAP}

  At the moment FreeJ is being released since it's early stages of development
according with GPL software tradictions, seeking collaborations of developers
interested in being involved and support from anybody else.  The actual 0.2
release (codename ETNA) represents a big step forward in development, packing
together a stable and usable application which allready offers users a
documented interface, revealing to be useful in a performance context.

  Further development is planned in the direction of integrating more layers:
soundscopes, static images, text and harddisk recorded videos, plus
implementing fade and chroma-key between them; as well development of more
chainable effects (about 20 algorithms) and documentation about how to develop
them. A main goal on which the project will be focusing it is to raise a
community of developers implementing filter effects, contributing in this way
to further spread realtime digital signal processing research in the video
field.

  Also user documentation will be extensively produced in the hope that
such an application will be useful in enhancing creativity of video
artists, specially those independent artists that, coming from a low-budget
situation, cannot afford expensive hardware/software proprietary solutions,
or even better those which make the Free Software the only resource for their 
productions.

  This release is simply intended to be the second step in a roadmap that
can resolve in a fully featured 1.0 release in 2 years from now, 
or even less, depending from received contributions for development.

{AVAILABILITY}

  Updated informations and FreeJ releases are made available on
{{http://freej.dyne.org}}. The bleeding edge sourcecode is also publicly
available thru CVS: instructions how to get anonymous CVS access and
possibility to browse the code online are given on {{http://cvs.dyne.org}}.
The latest sourcecode package is submitted to the metalab.unc.edu ftp
archive: latest FreeJ release can be found into the /pub/linux/apps/video
directory on any sunsite mirror worldwide. Also an archive containing all
past releases is made available on {{http://autistici.org/dyne/freej}}.

{SUPPORT}

  As allready mentioned, support is crucial for succesfully achieve the
implementation of planned features. The code will be hosted and developed
using the CVS server on {{http://cvs.dyne.org}}, opened to anybody's
contribution. Any organization or individual can also give significant
support contributing funds for involved developers, bandwidth for project
hosting, hardware for development, timespace where to present FreeJ thru
public lectures and/or performances and more generally credits and
citations. Every single contribution will be reported on the project's
documentation and the software itself will state it thru noticeable
credits. Besides that dyne.org staff is available to run formation courses
about usage, customization and reuse/abuse of the software in particular
circumstances. Even adhoc setup and/or warranty that FreeJ fits to
anybody's particular purpose can be requested: feel free to contact
<<freej-team@dyne.org>> for any further information.

{DISCUSSION}

 A mailinglist for further discussion about FreeJ is running as
<<freej@dyne.org>>, subscription is opened and anybody interested can send
a mail to <<freej-subscribe@dyne.org>> to join. Online archive and
mailinglist interface is made available on
