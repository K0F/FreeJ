.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBFreeJ\fP is a digital instrument for video livesets, featuring
realtime rendering of multilayered video and chained effect filtering
directly on the screen. FreeJ threats every video source as a layer,
making then possible to dynamically apply on each a chain of filters,
loadable as effect plugins and easily customizable. Layers are
implemented to mix together live inputs (video4linux devices),
DIVX/AVI files (with avifile library), PNG images and text files word
by word.

\fBFreeJ\fP is being developed in the hope to provide the free
software community with a modular and highly customizable application
for realtime video manipulation; a free and open framework that lets
anybody implement hisown filters concentrating simply on the dsp
algorithm developed and furthermore to combine them over any supported
layer.

\fBFreeJ\fP is a software written in C, C++ and a bit of assembler, it
can run on GNU/Linux platform and it could be ported to other
platforms; his sourcecode is released under the Gnu Public License, it
comes with absolutely no warranty, and you are welcome to redistribute
it under certain conditions (refer to the license for details).

\fBFreeJ\fP development is supported by the Nederlands Instituut voor
Mediakunst - Montevideo/Time Based Arts.

.SH FILES AND DEVICES
\fBFreeJ\fP supports an infinite number of layers, as much as your CPU
can handle. They can be layers of different types, depending on how
you (or your distribution) compiled this software: if any layer format
is missing then you can still make it work recompiling \fBFreeJ\fP
from the sources after installing all necessary libraries.

\fBSupported layers\fP include:
.IP "AVI (*.avi|*.asf|*.asf|*.wma|*.wmv|*.mov|*.mpeg)"
depends from \fBavifile\fP library \fIhttp://avifile.sf.net\fR
.IP "TXT (*.txt)"
depends from \fBfreetype\fP library \fIhttp://freetype.org\fR
.IP "V4L (/dev/video*|/dev/v4l/*)
depends from \fBvideo4linux\fP devices
.IP "PNG (*.png)"
