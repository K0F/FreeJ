Write your ideas here:

 - Javascript editor using scintilla (done with gtksourceview)
 - Reset button (experimental) - done
 - Info tooltip for layers

let's keep in mind  this gui is meant to run scripts
not to manipulate the state of the engine, but to aid debugging;
somehow also the "open file" button then becomes too much.
