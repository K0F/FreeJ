FreeJ 0.6 installation instructions
===================================

*** x86 PC (for Darwin/OSX see README.OSX)


== be sure to have all the required libraries and tools:

- NASM netwide assembler compiler
  from http://sf.net/projects/nasm

- SDL libraries
  from http://www.libsdl.org

- FreeType2 libraries 
  from http://www.freetype.org

  (don't forget to use ldconfig after installing libraries)

== to playback movies, install the video libraries in this order:
   FFMpeg library http://ffmpeg.sf.net
   Xvid library http://xvid.org
   AviFile library http://avifile.sourceforge.net

== to play with truetype rendered text install:
   Freetype2 http://freetype.org

== to play with PNG images you need PNG libs with Zlib support:
   PNG library (compile with _ZLIB_ support) http://libpng.org

== download freej latest stable version from http://ftp.dyne.org/freej
   extract the source archive and compile it:
   $ tar xvfz freej-0.6.tar.gz
   $ cd freej-0.6
    (if you are reading this file from the sourcecode, start from here)
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install

   this will install effect plugins into /usr/local/lib/freej/
   the freej binary in /usr/local/bin/
  (or any other prefix you configured instead of the default /usr/local)

   $ freej [enter]

   and you should see.



:: INSTALL FROM DEBIAN PACKAGES

You can do 'apt-get install freej' and you will have a precompiled FreeJ 
thanks to Guido Trotter.
Anyway, if you don't have Debian unstable you probably don't have it, or
have an very OLD version. To squeeze the best out of your box, you want
to compile this software yourself: the configure script will guess the
best for you in terms of compiler optimization flags for your CPU.



If you have problems, you are welcome to ask on the mailinglist for
help, there you will probably find somebody to help you.

Please try to not mix your problems with FreeJ's bugs.

If you find bugs, you are welcome to report them *in detail* into the
bugtracking system on http://bugs.dyne.org
