       BIG UP ALL FRIENDS & SET THE VJ FREE
                     by jaromil @ RASTASOFT 

:: OVERVIEW

FreeJ is a digital instrument for video livesets, featuring realtime
rendering of multilayered video and chained effect filtering directly
on the screen. FreeJ threats every video source as a layer, making
then possible to dynamically apply on each a chain of filters,
loadable as effect plugins and easily customizable. Layers are
implemented to mix together live inputs (video4linux devices),
DIVX/AVI files (with avifile library), PNG images and text files word
by word. Other layers are being implemented.

FreeJ is a software written in C, C++ and a bit of assembler, it can
run on GNU/Linux platform and it could be ported to other platforms:
any help on that is appreciated.

FreeJ is being developed in the hope to provide the free software
community with a modular and highly customizable application for
realtime video manipulation; a free and open framework that lets
anybody implement hisown filters concentrating simply on the dsp
algorithm developed and furthermore to combine them over any supported
layer.

:: DEVELOPERS

 jaromil - FreeJ author and mantainer
 kysucix - Truetype TXT Layer

You are very welcome to join, there is a lot of space for modules and a
pretty clear (and near to be freezed) API to be used.
In the near future there is going to be a procedural scripting language
to operate FreeJ. Have a look in the TODO file for some visions.
You can also follow development activity on http://lists.dyne.org/coding
