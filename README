     THIS IS RASTA SOFTWARE FOR THE FREEDOM OF VIDEO CREATION

:: OVERVIEW

FreeJ is a realtime video manipulation engine and a digital instrument
for veejays, featuring rendering of multilayered video and chained
effect filtering directly on the screen.

At the same time, FreeJ is a scriptable video engine that can interpret
scripts written in a intuitive and object oriented syntax (javascript).

FreeJ can layer various video sources, making then possible to
dynamically apply on each a chain of filters, masking operations etc.

Layers are implemented to mix together live video, movies, images,
texts, particle generators, vertical text scrollers and even more.
Everything can be controlled live and remotely with very low latency on
commands (VeeJay over Ethernet).

FreeJ's sourcecode is written in C, C++ and assembler, it can run on
GNU/Linux and Darwin/OSX platforms, PC-x86 or Mac, and is released free
under the GNU General Public License.



:: FEATURES

++ very efficient video engine with multithreaded layers
++ reads and renders layers from multiple sources:
   video4linux, divx/avi movies, png images and txt files
++ can be controlled from remote: VJoE - VeeJay over Ethernet
++ can be scripted in procedural object oriented language
++ plugin effects chainable on each layer
++ high precision looping of movie clips
++ Emacs/Vi style console with hotkeys and completion (S-Lang)
++ user friendly graphical interface (Gtk+2)
++ can have multiple controllers at the same time (Midi,Joystick)
++ 100% Free and opensource: GNU General Public License




:: FREE AS IN VEEJAY

This software started being developed by Jaromil, as a digital
instrument he used in dance-theater performances. Since 2001 ongoing
development took inspiration from various artists and programmers:
Roberto Paci Dalo', Francescopaolo Isidoro, Andreas Schiffler, Luigi
Pagliarini, Kentaro Fukuchi, Isabella Bordoni, to name just a few.

Set the VeeJay Free! was the first motto for this software.

FreeJ is released as free software with the intention to foster
creativity, artistic expression and research indypendently from
proprietary business products: to avoid that commercial companies own
the performability and reproducibility of our creations.

JAH BLESS YOU FOR THE GOOD OF YOUR CREATIONS, THIS IS RASTA SOFTWARE!

Recently Jaromil received support for FreeJ development: he was invited
to publish its code in an installation for the Withney ArtPort CODeDOC
(Ars Electronica 03), while during 2003/04 development has been
supported by the Netherlands Institute of Media Art.

Since the end of 2003, among other contributions, a brilliant coder
joined the project: Kysucix, contributing to new core features.

For the time being, FreeJ is employed in various video performances and
installations, but also used for medical analisys visualizations.
And its horizons of use are now growing with scripting of operations.

Both active developers are keen to accept projects and propositions in
order to sustain the development activity on this free software, please
contact us on http://dyne.org if you think we can collaborate.






:: GET STARTED

To start rolling with FreeJ you can have a tour of the online tutorial
(see http://freej.dyne.org documentation section), interact directly
with the GTK+2 interface to get familiar with layers and effects and
then go to the USAGE file which has a more complete reference table for
hotkeys and advanced console use.




:: REQUIREMENTS

To run FreeJ is necessary to have:

- a working GNU/Linux workstation
  or Darwin/OSX -> see the documentation in README.OSX 

- SDL libraries http://www.libsdl.org

Optionally, you want to have installed the following libraries:

Image Layer:
- PNG libraries http://www.libpng.org

Text Layer:
- FreeType2 libraries http://freetype.org

Movie Layer:
- XVid libraries http://xvid.org
- FFMpeg libraries http://ffmpeg.sf.net (get latest from 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=16082)
- AviFile libraries http://avifile.sf.net

PC x86 assembler effects:
- NASM netwide assembler compiler http://nasm.sf.net

Live video Layer:
- BTTV / WinTV and similar cards supported by a Video4Linux driver

For better fullscreen support try to add to your XF86Config  file  the
modelines in doc/x11.modelines
