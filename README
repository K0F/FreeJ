     THIS IS RASTA SOFTWARE FOR THE FREEDOM OF VIDEO CREATION

:: OVERVIEW

FreeJ is a realtime video manipulation engine and a digital instrument
for livesets, featuring rendering of multilayered video and chained
effect filtering directly on the screen.
FreeJ threats every video source as a layer, making then possible to
dynamically apply on each a chain of filters.
Layers are implemented to mix together live video, movies, images and
texts.
Everything can be controlled live, also remotely, or scripted using an
object oriented API with javascript syntax.

FreeJ's sourcecode is written in C, C++ and assembler, it can run on
GNU/Linux and Darwin/OSX platforms, PC-x86 or Mac.



:: FREE AS IN VEEJAY

This software has started as an artist tool used in dance-theater
performances by its author, being developed since 2001 also with
contributions from programmers and artists. A study realized with FreeJ
was featured by the Withney ArtPort (CODeDOC II/AEC03), while during
2003/04 development has been supported by the Netherlands Institute of
Media Art.

By releasing FreeJ as free software, the intention is to foster
creativity, artistic expression and research indypendently from
proprietary business products: to avoid that commercial companies own
the performability and reproducibility of our creations.

Set the VeeJay Free! was the first motto for this software.

For the time being, FreeJ is employed in various video performances and
installations, but also used for medical analisys visualizations.
And its horizons of use are now growing with scriptability.

FreeJ is free software and its sourcecode is released under the GNU
General Public License, it comes with absolutely no warranty, while you
are welcome to hire or team-up with the developers in order to have
support using it. 






:: FEATURES

++ reads from multiple sources:
   video4linux, divx/avi movies, png images and txt files
++ can be controlled from remote: VJoE - VeeJay over Ethernet
++ very efficient video engine with multithreaded layers
++ plugin effects chainable on each layer
++ user friendly graphical interface (Gtk+2)
++ Emacs/Vi style console with hotkeys and completion (S-Lang)
++ Midi and Joystick controllers
++ Object Oriented scriptable API (Javascript)
++ 100% GNU General Public License Free Software




:: GET STARTED

To start rolling with FreeJ you can have a tour of the online tutorial
(see http://freej.dyne.org documentation section), interact directly
with the GTK+2 interface to get familiar with layers and effects and
then go to the USAGE file which has a more complete reference table for
hotkeys and advanced console use.




:: REQUIREMENTS

- a working GNU/Linux workstation
  or Darwin/OSX -> see the documentation in README.OSX 

- SDL libraries http://www.libsdl.org
