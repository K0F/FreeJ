                  set the vj free
 free unified framework for realtime video processing

              (( coded by jaromil ))

:: OVERVIEW

FreeJ aims to be a digital instrument for  video  livesets,  featuring
realtime rendering of multilayered video and chained effect  filtering
directly on the screen.  FreeJ threats every video source as a  layer,
making then possible to dynamically apply on each a chain of  filters,
loadable as effect plugins and easily customizable. Layers are planned
for rendering of  analog  video  input,  digital  movie  files,  image
bitmaps, sound scopes, texts and eventually more.

FreeJ is being developed in the hope to provide the GNU community with
a free, modular and highly customizable application to  perform  video
livesets, based on a GPL'ed framework that lets anybody implement  his
own filters concentrating simply on the dsp  algorithm  developed  and
furthermore to combine them over any supported layer.

FreeJ is Free Software and his sourcecode is released  under  the  Gnu
Public License, it comes with  absolutely  no  warranty  and  you  are
welcome to redistribute it under  certain  conditions  (refer  to  the
license for details).

:: INTERNALS

FreeJ, as a free  modularized  GNU/Linux  framework,  permits  unified
quality control over the rendering of  digital  video  processing  and
makes it much easier to write effect algorithms keeping them
compatible with as much devices as possible and making them relying on
optimized code.

FreeJ is being developed in c++ respecting POSIX compliance,  releases
will be made available in a packaging permitting easy compilation with
standard GNU free development tools.
For rendering to screen is being linked shared the Simple Direct Media
Layer [http://www.libsdl.org] library, allready employed by
lokigames.org for his high performance in porting games like
QuakeIII(tm) under GNU/Linux platform.

As a realtime  architecture  FreeJ  aims  to  make  efficient  use  of
multithreading optimizing the usage of  hardware  resources.   There's
only one layer implemented yet  wich  makes  use  of  the  video4linux
abstracted device for capturing live video input from the  many  linux
supported hardware devices (which includes bttv, usb cams  and  more).
Alltough possible, is not planned any porting to platforms other  than
GNU/Linux at least in the earliest development phases.

:: FEATURES

++ multilayered video engine
++ layer filtering thru chainable dsp algorithms
++ easy customization of filters
++ MMX/SSE accelerated engine lubrification
++ efficient triple-buffered video grabbing layer
++ modular c++ code structure
++ multithreaded architecture (POSIX.1b compliant)
++ (ab)user friendly OnScreenDisplay interface

:: REQUIREMENTS

To run FreeJ is necessary to have:

- a working x86 GNU/Linux workstation ;)
- SDL libraries <http://www.libsdl.org>
- NASM <ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/nasm>
- XFree86, possibly 4.1  running  on  a  supported  accelerated  card.
- a video4linux supported grabbing card

For better fullscreen support try to add to your XF86Config  file  the
modelines in doc/x11.modelines.

:: SUPPORT

Have a look on our recent project DyneBolic: http://dynebolic.dyne.org
we are shipping this CD  in  order  to  support  development  of  this
software: by buying it you will help much, please  consider  making  a
donation to us in this way!

dyne.org staff is also available to run formation courses about usage,
customization and reuse/abuse of the software in particular
circumstances.  Even adhoc setup and/or warranty that  FreeJ  fits  to
anybody's particular purpose can be requested: feel  free  to  contact
<freej-team@dyne.org> for any further information.

Any organization or individual can also give  significant  support  by
donating funds for  involved  developers,  hardware  for  development,
timespace where to present FreeJ thru public lectures and/or
performances and more generally credits and citations.   Every  single
contribution will be reported on the project's documentation  and  the
software itself will state it thru noticeable credits.

:: AVAILABILITY

Updated informations and FreeJ releases are made available on
[http://freej.dyne.org]. The bleeding edge sourcecode is also publicly
available thru CVS on [http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freej]  (there
you will find instructions on how to get and browse online the  code).

:: ROADMAP

At the moment FreeJ is being released in a early stage of  development
according with GPL software  tradictions,  seeking  collaborations  of
developers interested in being involved and support from anybody else.
Alltough the code is mature enough to be  appreciated  by  coders  and
effects can allready be implemented with noticeable good  performance.
The 0.1 release is simply intended to be the beginning of a developing
roadmap that can resolve in a fully featured 1.0 release in 1/2  years
depending from received contributions, even less in the most
optimistic case.

:: DISCUSSION

A mailinglist  for  further  discussion  about  FreeJ  is  running  as
<freej@dyne.org>, subscription is opened and  anybody  interested  can
send a mail to <freej-subscribe@dyne.org> to join. Online archive and
mailinglist interface is made available on
[http://dyne.org/cgi-bin/ml.cgi?4] .
