:: OVERVIEW

FreeJ is a digital instrument for video livesets, featuring realtime
rendering of multilayered video and chained effect filtering directly
on the screen. FreeJ threats every video source as a layer, making
then possible to dynamically apply on each a chain of filters,
loadable as effect plugins and easily customizable. Layers are
implemented to mix together live inputs (video4linux devices),
DIVX/AVI files (with avifile library), PNG images and text files word
by word. Other layers are being implemented.

FreeJ is a software written in C, C++ and a bit of assembler, it can
run on GNU/Linux platform and it could be ported to other platforms:
any help on that is appreciated.

FreeJ is being developed in the hope to provide the free software
community with a modular and highly customizable application to
perform video livesets; a free and open framework that lets anybody
implement hisown filters concentrating simply on the dsp algorithm
developed and furthermore to combine them over any supported layer.

:: FEATURES

++ reads from multiple sources:
   video4linux, divx/avi movies, png images and txt files
++ multithreaded layered video engine
++ layer filtering thru chainable dsp algorithms
++ DSO plugin filters
++ MMX/SSE accelerated engine lubrification
++ efficient triple-buffered video grabbing layer
++ modular c++ code structure (POSIX.1b compliant)
++ (ab)user friendly OnScreenDisplay interface
++ 100% GNU Public License Free Software




:: REQUIREMENTS

To run FreeJ is necessary to have:

- a working GNU/Linux workstation with a MMX capable CPU
- SDL libraries <http://www.libsdl.org>
- PNG libraries <http://www.libpng.org>
- FreeType2 libraries
- NASM <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/nasm>
- XFree86 4.2 or latest, better with an accelerated videocard

Optionally, you might want to have:
- a video4linux supported grabbing card for live video
- avifile libraries for realtime AVI playback and mixing

For better fullscreen support try to add to your XF86Config  file  the
modelines in doc/x11.modelines.




:: INSTALL FROM SOURCE

*** YOU MUST READ THE INSTALL FILE NOW

once you have installed all the required libraries, just do: 

 ./configure
 make
 make install

filter plugins will be installed into /usr/local/lib/freej (or another
prefix if you changed the default one).

For fullscreen support you might want to add in your XF86Config file the
modelines included into doc/x11.modelines.

:: INSTALL FROM DEBIAN PACKAGES

you can do 'apt-get install freej' and you will have a precompiled freej
which is NOT optimized for your computer.
