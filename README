 free unified framework for realtime video processing

:: OVERVIEW

FreeJ is a digital instrument for video livesets, featuring realtime
rendering of multilayered video and chained effect filtering directly
on the screen. FreeJ threats every video source as a layer, making
then possible to dynamically apply on each a chain of filters,
loadable as effect plugins and easily customizable. Layers are
implemented to mix together live inputs (video4linux devices),
DIVX/AVI files (with avifile library), PNG images and text files word
by word. Other layers are being implemented.

FreeJ is a software written in C, C++ and a bit of assembler, it can
run on GNU/Linux platform and it could be ported to other platforms:
any help on that is appreciated.

FreeJ is being developed in the hope to provide the free software
community with a modular and highly customizable application to
perform video livesets; a free and open framework that lets anybody
implement hisown filters concentrating simply on the dsp algorithm
developed and furthermore to combine them over any supported layer.

:: FEATURES

++ multilayered video engine
++ filters loaded as runtime DSO plugins
++ layer filtering thru chainable dsp algorithms
++ MMX/SSE accelerated engine lubrification
++ efficient triple-buffered video grabbing layer
++ modular c++ code structure
++ multithreaded architecture (POSIX.1b compliant)
++ (ab)user friendly OnScreenDisplay interface




:: REQUIREMENTS

To run FreeJ is necessary to have:

- a working GNU/Linux workstation with a MMX capable CPU
- SDL libraries <http://www.libsdl.org>
- PNG libraries <http://www.libpng.org>
- FreeType2 libraries
- NASM <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/nasm>
- XFree86 4.2 or latest, better with an accelerated videocard

Optionally, you might want to have:
- a video4linux supported grabbing card for live video
- avifile libraries for realtime AVI playback and mixing

For better fullscreen support try to add to your XF86Config  file  the
modelines in doc/x11.modelines.




:: INSTALL FROM SOURCE

YOU MUST READ THE INSTALL FILE

once you have installed all the required libraries, just do: 

 ./configure
 make
 make install

filter plugins will be installed into /usr/local/lib/freej (or another
prefix if you changed the default one).

For fullscreen support you might want to add in your XF86Config file the
modelines included into doc/x11.modelines.

:: INSTALL FROM DEBIAN PACKAGES

you can do 'apt-get install freej' and you will have a version of freej
which is not compiled against avifile libraries (you can't play .avi).

if you want to have .avi files played on debian you have to compile
freej from source.
you can install avifile .deb packages from marillat.free.fr
libavifile0-dev
avifile-win32-plugin
and then you must recompile freej (if you did a configure allready do a
'make distclean' before the next compilation).


:: DISCUSSION

Freej.org website is a dynamic web portal offering community facilities
as discussion forums, user registration and polls.

A mailinglist  for  further  discussion  about  FreeJ  is  running  as
<freej@dyne.org>, subscription is opened and  anybody  interested  can
send a mail to <freej-subscribe@dyne.org> to join. Online archive is
on http://dyne.org/cgi-bin/ml.cgi?4 .




:: AVAILABILITY

Updated informations and FreeJ releases are made available on
http://freej.dyne.org . The bleeding edge sourcecode is also publicly
available thru CVS on http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freej (there you
will find instructions on how to get and browse online the code).
