          RASTA SOFTWARE FOR THE FREEDOM OF VIDEO CREATION

:: OVERVIEW

FreeJ is a vision mixer: a digital instrument for realtime video
manipulation used in the fields of dance teather, veejaying, medical
visualisation and TV.

It runs a video engine in which multiple layers can be filtered thru
effect chains and then mixed together with images, movies, live
cameras, particle generators, text scrollers and scripted vector
graphics. All the resulting video mix can be shown on a screen,
encoded into a movie and streamed live to the internet.

FreeJ can be controlled locally or remotely, also from multiple places
at the same time, using its ascii console interface; operations can be
automated via javascript, also MIDI and Joystick controllers can be
scripted.

FreeJ's sourcecode is written in portable C and C++, it can run on
GNU/Linux and Darwin/OSX platforms, PC-x86 or Mac, and is released
free under the GNU General Public License.



:: FEATURES

++ reads and renders layers from multiple sources:
   webcams, TV, divx/avi movies, images and txt files
++ can encode in Ogg/Theora video, recording on local file
   and streaming live to an online Icecast server
++ can be controlled from remote: VJoE - VeeJay over Ethernet
++ can be scripted in procedural object oriented language
++ high precision looping of movie clips
++ plugin effects are chainable on each layer
++ very efficient video engine with multithreaded layers
++ Emacs/Vi style console with hotkeys and completion (S-Lang)
++ multiple controllers at the same time (Midi,Joystick)
++ 100% Free and open source: GNU General Public License




:: HISTORY

This software started being developed as a digital instrument Jaromil
used in dance-theater performances. Since 2001 ongoing development
took inspiration from various artists and programmers: Andreas
Schiffler, Roberto Paci Dalo', Tom Demeyer, Francescopaolo Isidoro,
Kentaro Fukuchi, Luigi Pagliarini, Isabella Bordoni, to name just a
few.

Set the VeeJay Free! was the first motto for this software.

In 2003 Kysucix joined development contributing the streaming feature
and helping to include the javascript parser. He employed FreeJ in
interactive installations while working with Studio Azzurro.

Since 2004 development has been supported by the Netherlands Media Art
Insitute employing

In 2005 Mr.Goil joined the project writing programmable controllers
and debugging the scripting environment.

For the time being, FreeJ is employed in various video performances and
installations, but also used for medical analisys visualizations.

Developers are keen to accept projects and propositions in order to
sustain the development activity on this free software, please contact
us on http://dyne.org if you think we can collaborate.




:: GET STARTED

To start rolling with FreeJ you can have a look to the online
documentation on it website http://freej.dyne.org

- SDL libraries http://www.libsdl.org
- PNG libraries http://www.libpng.org
- S-LANG libraries http://www.s-lang.org
- Ogg/Vorbis/Theora libraries http://www.xiph.org




:: HOW TO INSTALL IT

download a binary for your operating system from http://freej.org or
try dyne:bolic GNU/Linux http://dynebolic.org which includes it ready
to use from a liveCD which is also easy to install.

Debian GNU/Linux users can 'apt-get install freej',

Gentoo GNU/Linux users can 'emerge freej'

But if the package of your distribution is out of date you should
compile from source for the latest features.
