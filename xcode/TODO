- full-screen for the main video output window
- Implement blitting-code to handle frames coming from other type 
  of layers provided by the freej engine
- Fix and activate-back support to load and execute javascript code
- Allow to select a different blendmode for each layer (we should
  at least provide access to all blendmodes exposed by  CoreImage
  on a default osx installation)
- Allow to select the filter to apply on a specific layer
  (we actually allow to use only a ZoomBlur but lot more are available
  by default and users could have installed custom filters as well)
- Implement a CVGenerator layer class for easy access to 'generators' 
  included provided by CIFilters 
- Include filters and effects usage in the videograb layer 
- Implement a javascript console to let user insert exec javascript 
  code directly from the gui
- build the deck panel programmatically (instead of having 
  it statically defined in the nib file)
- implement a native text-layer (should be trivial)
- implement a freej-output-preview window to use when on a dual-screen 
  workstation and running freej in full-screen mode
