- allow to unload/reload javascript files
- Allow to select the filter to apply on a specific layer
  (we actually allow to use only a ZoomBlur but lot more are available
  by default and users could have installed custom filters as well)
- Implement a CVGenerator layer class for easy access to 'generators' 
  included provided by CIFilters 
- Implement a javascript console to let user insert exec javascript 
  code directly from the gui
- implement a native text-layer (should be trivial)
- implement a freej-output-preview window to use when on a dual-screen 
  workstation and running freej in full-screen mode 
- build the deck panel programmatically (instead of having 
  it statically defined in the nib file)
