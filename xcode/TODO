- configuration panel to set preview-fps, resolution and such (WIP)
- allow to instantiate new layers
- allow to attach the effectspanel to any layer present in the sortable list
  (so also internal layers ... which don't have their own panel on the gui)
- Implement a javascript console to let user insert exec javascript 
  code directly from the gui
- implement a freej-output-preview window to use when on a dual-screen 
  workstation and running freej in full-screen mode 
- build the deck panel programmatically (instead of having 
  it statically defined in the nib file)
- the whole GUI needs refactoring
