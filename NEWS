Freej 0.2.1 "ETNA" release

Better performance and overall stability due to a total rewrite of the multithreaded
mechanism, user friendly commandline options added, new small asm filter coding
example, some other bugfixes and code cleanup.

This release represents a very good step towards stability and maximum performance
for FreeJ, i substituted the synchronous object mechanism with a simplier mutex
driven locking mechanism, using pthreads library directly: it revelaled to be a
major improvement, so much that i decided to leave the FreeJ code for a while and
implement this same way to handle multithreading also into MuSE http://muse.dyne.org
so this release now comes after one month lying into the CVS, extensively tested in
two video performances i did in the meantime. I took back that code three days ago
and started smoothing it as i stepped into the LOA hacklab here in Milano, where i
spent last wildcoding days with some real friends :) so here it is the 0.2.1
enjoy!
