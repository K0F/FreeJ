The first Piksel meeting http://piksel.no was happening recently hosted
in Bergen (Norway) by the BEK - there i met other developers of free
software for realtime video processing. That was indeed very inspiring
and i'm looking forward to share some more code and components between
our applications.

FreeJ workshops were held in several locations in Netherlands,
co-produced by the Nederlands Instituut voor Mediakunst:
BigM (festival tent), VisualSensations (VJ workshops)
and Grafisch Lyceum Amsterdam

other goodies in which FreeJ is being used:

** TRE - http://korova.dyne.org/TRE

** PANE performing video (together with DinDon)
