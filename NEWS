I'm now getting support, encouragement and ideas from Montevideo to
further development of FreeJ, hurray. you'll see some more in future!

The first Piksel meeting http://piksel.no was happening recently hosted
in Bergen (Norway) by the BEK - there i met other developers of free
software for realtime video processing. That was indeed very inspiring
and i'm looking forward to share some more code and components between
our applications.

meanwhile, see how i'm using this stuff:

** TRE - http://korova.dyne.org/TRE

** PANE performing video (together with DinDon)
ftp://ftp.dyne.org/performance/pane.txt
ftp://ftp.dyne.org/performance/pane.avi

** TUBOCATODICO - http://tubocatodico.dyne.org

** MITOCONDRI - http://mitocondri.dyne.org


if you are using FreeJ in some way let me know, i will link your thing
here and on the webpages.


if you want to organize a workshop, presentation, installation or
performance let me know, i love to do that and FreeJ is phun :)

mail me jaromil /@/ dyne.org
thanks for your interest
