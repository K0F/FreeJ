FreeJ 0.7.1 notes for Darwin/OSX hackers

FreeJ is NOW READY to be used on Darwin and OSX!

to compile it from source follow these steps, which are also useful to
setup your Apple OSX to be able to compile and use other GNU software.

- First check if you've got the following stuff covered:                   

1. OSX version 10.3.x
2. XCode Apple Developers tools including GNU C compiler
   download from http://developer.apple.com (free registration)
   then go to "download software" -- "developer tools" -- and
   spend a long time downloading.
4. know what a Terminal is and how to open one
   (see Appendix.1 further down in this document)
3. know how become root on your machine from a Terminal
   (see Appendix.2 if you need help on this)

- Then proceed with the install of the latest Fink
  free software packaging system available from http://fink.sf.net

- Once you are done with all the installation steps of Fink, open your
  Terminal and become root (sudo bash), then issue the following
  commands which will install opensource packages of needed software
  libraries:

# apt-get install pkgconfig
# apt-get install slang
# apt-get install sdl
# apt-get install libpng3
# apt-get install freetype2-dev


- OPTIONAL and NOT recommended:
  if you want to compile the gtk+2 graphical interface
# apt-get install gtk+2-dev
# apt-get install libglade2
# apt-get install glib2-dev
# apt-get install pango1-dev
# apt-get install atk1
# apt-get install libxml2
then you need to configure FreeJ at compile time with--enable-glade2
and start it from an X11 terminal. This is not recommended anymore as
long the GTK2 graphical interface has been deprecated for lack of
performance and usability.


- OPTIONAL and WELL RECOMMENDED:
  if you want to compile the Javascript interpreter download the
  SpiderMonkey engine from http://mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey
  it's js-1.5.tar.gz in http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js
  decompress it, enter the directory and type
  $ make -f Makefile.ref
  which will compile it into a static library;
  then come back into the freej directory and configure using the flag:
  --with-javascript=/full/path/to/js
Compiling FreeJ with this feature will give you the possibility to
script procedural video with text and images!

  if you want to compile movie playback support, you can compile
  statically an appropriate version of libavcodec (ffmpeg).

To finally compile FreeJ enter its directory and issue the commands:
# ./configure (optional flags here)
# make
# make install

This will install effect plugins into the dire /usr/local/lib/freej 
and the freej binary in /usr/local/bin (or any --prefix configured)

from a Terminal (X11 Terminal in case of GTK2 interface) type:
$ freej [enter]
and you should see.

in case you want to have a colorful command console on your terminal,
before starting freej you can type 'screen' (enter), this will start
a console manager which fully supports ANSI colors (see 'man screen').


================================== Appendix.1 : open the Terminal

The terminal is an application that lets you controll your computer
through commandline. You need it to perform UNIX operations such as
startup GNU applications, login to remote computers using ssh, compiling
software from source and more.
You can find your terminal in /Applications/Utilities/


================================== Appendix.2 : become Root

If you log in on your machine, you're not automaticaly root, even if you
have admin privileges. Become super user of your own machine by starting
'Network Utility' (Aplications/Utilities). Click 'security' in the
menubar and then 'enable root', choose a password (p rotect it with your
life and NEVER forget it). Now you are super user and can log in as root
in your Terminal by typing:
#su
password:XXXXXXXXXXX
the '#' means your root, '$' means your user
(BTW there is also the trick of using "sudo bash" from your first user)




MacOSX binary packages are on the way to be offered to public.

you are welcome to join development of course, FreeJ still needs to
be slick enough on MacOSX and lacks of a Quicktime layer.
